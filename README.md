# IntroCodingQuiz
hw4 
This is a coding quiz! When the user opens the website they are met with the home screen for the website. In the header of the home screen the user can click on the left corner link (view highest results), and they will be taken to a new tab that displays the highest scores. On the right hand side of the header is a timer which will only start once the user presses the start button. When the user presses the start button the user has a series of questions to answer, if they answer incorrectly, they lose 10 seconds off thier timer. Once the timer hits zero (or they answer all the questions). The user is prompted to enter their initials to be saved on the highest results page.
